# enhanced car management system 
In this exercise, you will create a more complex Ruby program involving the Car class. This program will not only handle car properties but also include a collection of cars and perform various operations using built-in array methods.

## Define a Car class:
 - The class should initialize with a make, model, and color. Include methods to get and set each of these attributes.
 - Add a method info that returns a string with all the car's details.

## Create a Garage class:
 - This class will manage a collection of Car objects.
 - Implement methods to add a car, remove a car by make and model, and list all cars.
 - Add a method to find all cars of a specific color.
 - add a method to clear all cars from the garage.

## Write tests for both classes:
 - Test all the functionalities of the Car and Garage classes.
